# Codes for experiments in [*Detecting Planted Partition in Sparse Multi-Layer Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07554)
This Github repository contains codes for experiments presented in our paper [Detecting Planted Partition in Sparse Multi-Layer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07554). We provide codes for generating figures $2-5$ from Section 5. The images, results, and corresponding generating scripts are organized as follows:

* Experiments from Section 5.1 (Dependence on Sample Size) -- [Over N](https://github.com/anirbanc96/Sparse-MCSBM/tree/main/Over%20N).
  * The results are obtained by running `Body.R`
